This is an end-project of our Java course: to realize a software (system) with the function of viewing pictures and management. It's a very powerful and useful tool that you can easily handle pictures in your personal computer, enjoy your time with your photos and enjoy our app ðŸ˜˜. If you have any ideas or advice, just open an issue or create a pull request.

Here are some basic functions:

* Copy / Cut and paste
* Delete
* Rename
* Check out the attributes
* Multiple Selection

By double-clicking the thumbnail, it will show the picture in a separate window with some features below:

* Zoom in / Zoom out
* Switch pictures
* Slide show

We also maintain some creative features in this app for you :

* OCR text recognition
* Picture compression
* History records
* Picture stitching
* Sorting
* More...

# Appearance

We useÂ [JFoenix](http://www.jfoenix.com) to compose a wonderful user interfaceÂ with Material Design.

> Note: Remember to install the **Lombok Plugin** when using IDEA or Eclipse, otherwise the editor would come up with false alarms.

# FAQ

We recommend you to open this project in IDEA.

### I have downloaded all the dependencies, why still so many errors? (say some getter or setter doesn't exist)
Install the **Lombok Plugin** in your IDEA or Eclipse, otherwise the editor would come up with false alarms.
